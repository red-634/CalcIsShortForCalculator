# Scientific Calculator (Python)

A simple command-line scientific calculator written in Python.  
It supports basic arithmetic, roots, powers, logarithms, and trigonometric functions (including their inverses).
Remember- errors are part of the codes character :)

## Files

- **Main calc file.py**  
  The main program. Displays a menu, takes user input, and calls the appropriate calculation function.

- **calculationfunctions.py**  
  Contains all the calculation functions. Each function prompts the user for input and prints the result.

## Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Power, Square Root, Cube Root
- Logarithm (any base)
- Trigonometric functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent (degrees/radians)
- Inverse trigonometric functions: arcsin, arccos, arctan

## How to Run

1. Make sure both files are in the same folder.
2. Open a terminal in that folder.
3. Run.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts.

## Notes

- All inputs are taken interactively.
- For multiplication, you can enter any number of values separated by spaces.
- Trigonometric functions let you choose between radians and degrees.

## Future
- Will be adding a GUI and function line to mimic a real calculator

Enjoy calculating!
